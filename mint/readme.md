# Mint
This folder holds a mint script for minting an NFT from a collection deployed by the Lighthouse contract. in the config.json you can enter the lighthouse contract address (sei1hjsqrfdg2hvwl3gacg4fkznurf36usrv7rkzkyh29wz3guuzeh0snslz7d) a RPC of your choice and you can edit the gas price (default is 0.1usei).

at the moment this only works for public mint types, not when a whitelisted mint is going on.

## Run
First install the dependancies, npm install
Then complete the config.json
Then run the script with node mint.js
