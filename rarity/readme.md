# Rarity
This folder holds a script that can download the metadata files of a collection address and calculate the rarity based on the metadata files. All you have to do is find the collection address of a NFT project, go to seiscan.app and check one of the contract states that holds the token_uri, usually an Arweave file or IPFS.

## Run
Change the variables inside the config.json 
Run python3 rarityCheck.py
